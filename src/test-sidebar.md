# Sidebar Test Log

## Changes Made:
1. Fixed Layout.tsx to render TrakSenseSidebar directly (removed wrapper div that was hiding it)
2. Modified TrakSenseSidebar to always render DesktopSidebar, with CSS-based responsive behavior
3. DesktopSidebar now includes `hidden md:flex md:flex-col` classes to hide on mobile, show on desktop
4. TopBar correctly imports and uses MobileSidebar for mobile navigation
5. Cleaned up redundant responsive classes

## Expected Behavior:
- Desktop (â‰¥768px): Shows vertical sidebar on left, with collapse/expand functionality
- Mobile (<768px): Shows hamburger menu in TopBar, opens sheet/drawer when clicked
- All navigation items preserved with proper styling (active pill, hover states, etc.)

## Test Steps:
1. Load application on desktop - sidebar should be visible on left
2. Click collapse button - sidebar should shrink to icon-only mode
3. Resize window to mobile - sidebar should disappear, hamburger should appear in header
4. Click hamburger on mobile - should open slide-out menu from left
5. Navigation should work in both desktop and mobile modes
